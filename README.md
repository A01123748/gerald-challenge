# Gerald-Challenge

Gerald-Challenge is a react-native example of how to use react-native-reanimated library created with expo for ease of use.
The solutions uses react-native-reanimated to include animations for the drawer.
Additionally it uses the required navigation pattern with some dummy screens.
The look and feel is the more similar I could make it. With enough time I can make it overlap the right screen so that it looks exactly as the gif.
